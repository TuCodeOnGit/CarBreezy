        <strong>It's a used car</strong> so need to check more things than new car. Moreover, in order to test drive the
        car while ensuring that the ability to cross corners, go up and downhill, and not affect traffic, it is
        necessary to have an appropriate location, not a city road.<br> Must be suburban roads, empty of cars.
        Therefore, buyers should ask for a longer test period to better consider both design, operation and features in
        the car.
